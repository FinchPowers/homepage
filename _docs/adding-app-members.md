You can add your team members to your app in Seed with a few simple steps. Head over to your app settings and hit **Show App Members**.

![Show App Members](/assets/docs/adding-app-members/show-app-members.png)

Here you'll notice the folks that are a part of the app and the ones that have been invited.

Note that the above setting only applies to personal apps. For apps created within an organization you can add your team members at an organizational level. You can read more about [adding members to your organization here]({% link _docs/adding-organization-members.md %}).

You can add a team member to this project with their email. If they don't have a Seed account, they'll need to sign up for one with the email address you are inviting them with.

Currently, all app members have complete control over the app. They can add or remove other app members. However, the original app creator cannot be removed from the app.
