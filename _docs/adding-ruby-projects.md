title: Adding Ruby Projects

Seed gives you a simple way to deploy Serverless Ruby 2.5 & 2.7 projects. We provide out-of-the-box support for packages installed using [Bundler](https://bundler.io).

You can also run your tests using [RSpec](http://rspec.info).

We created [a simple starter project](https://github.com/fwang/serverless-ruby-starter) that you can use. It shows an example using Bundler and RSpec.
