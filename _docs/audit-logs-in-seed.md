title: Audit Logs in Seed
---

An Audit Log is a complete log of all the events in your organization in Seed. It keeps track of the activity of all the members in your organization. And it also keeps track of events generated by the Seed build system and your Git provider (commits, branches, PRs, etc.).

Note that, the audit log is available as a part of our [**Enterprise plan**]({% link pricing.html %}). 

You can use the audit log to track down issues, get an overview of your team's activity, and follow good security practices. Audit logs in Seed are retroactive. This means that you'll always be able to access historical records in case there is an issue. Audit logs in Seed are also really comprehensive. You can rest assured knowing that you can always refer back to them if you need to.

View your audit log by heading over to your organization settings and clicking on **View Audit Log**.

Let's quickly go over some of the features of the audit logs in Seed.

1. **Immutability**

   The events recorded in the audit log are immutable. This means that once an event has been recorded in the audit log, it won't be altered or removed. Events that are generated when a resource is removed, are logged as a separate entry. 

2. **Time Synced**

   Events in the audit log can originate from multiple types of sources (users, the Seed build system, your Git provider, etc.). Seed ensures that the events from these sources are time synced. Meaning that the order of these events are accurate in the way they were centrally processed.

3. **Exportable**

   Your audit logs can be exported so you can process them programmatically on your end. Please [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you'd like your audit logs exported to a CSV. 

4. **Customizable Retention Time**

   Currently, audit logs in Seed are retained indefinitely, unless specified. If you'd like to change this to enforce your organization's data retention policy, please [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

5. **Real-Time**

   Events in the audit log are recorded in real-time. This means that you won't have to wait for these events to be processed before viewing them.

6. **Retroactive Records**

   Audit logs in Seed are retroactive. So once they've been enabled for your organization, you'll be able to go back and access historical data.

The above features combined, ensures that the audit logs in Seed will have you covered when you really need them.
