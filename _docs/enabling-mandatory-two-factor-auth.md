title: Enabling Mandatory Two-Factor Auth
---

Seed supports two-factor authentication. And organizations on Seed can make it mandatory for their members to have to enable two-factor authentication on their accounts.

Mandatory two-factor auth is available as a part of our **Enterprise** plans. [Contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you would like to enable this for your organization.

You can head over to your organization settings and hit **Manage Members**.

And hit **Enable Mandatory 2FA**.

Note that, you'll need to be an _admin_ of the organization to be able to enable this setting.

Once enabled, your team members will be prompted to setup two-factor auth when they visit your organization on Seed.

Mandatory two-factor auth helps enforce good security practices across your organization.
