title: Manually Deploying

You can trigger one-off deployments to a stage from any branch. This can be useful when you want to test a hotfix branch in your staging environment.

To do so, go to the service you want to deploy and hit **Settings**.

Select **Trigger Deploy**.

You'll be asked to pick a branch to deploy.

And hitting **Deploy Branch** triggers a one-off deployment to the current stage.
