You can trigger one-off deployments to any stage or service in Seed. This can be useful for example, when you want to test a hotfix branch in your staging environment.

### Manually Deploy a Stage

To manually deploy a stage, select the stage.

![Select stage](/assets/docs/manually-deploying/select-stage.png)

And hit **Trigger Deploy**.

![Hit stage trigger deploy](/assets/docs/manually-deploying/hit-stage-trigger-deploy.png)

Here you'll be prompted to select a branch you want to deploy with. Or if this stage has a branch connected to it, you'll be asked if you want to deploy using it.

### Manually Deploy a Service

To deploy a specific service. Select the service.

![Select service](/assets/docs/manually-deploying/select-service.png)

Here you'll notice the service listed across all the stages. Hit **Trigger Deploy** for the stage you want to trigger a deployment in.

Just as above, you'll be asked to select a branch.
