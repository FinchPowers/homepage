Stages in Seed are usually tied to a Git branch. You can read more about [adding a stage here]({% link _docs/adding-a-stage.md %}). Seed can also automatically create stages when a new Git branch is created.

> We currently support automatic branch deployments only for GitHub.

[Contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if youâ€™d like to use it for Bitbucket or GitLab.

Head over to your app, click **Settings** and hit **Enable Auto-Deploy Branches**.

Here you can specify a stage to inherit the environment variables and other settings from. For example, your `dev` stage might be configured with environment variables for your app and with a set of IAM credentials specific for dev deployments. By selecting the `dev` stage, any stage that is automatically created for a new branch will inherit the settings from the `dev` stage.

Seed will inherit the following settings (if available) from the selected stage:

- IAM settings
- Post-deploy phase
- Notification settings
- Environment variables

You can also specify what you want to do once the branch is closed. By hitting the **Remove the stage and all the resources when the branch is deleted** checkbox, you are telling Seed to remove the automatically deployed stage and all the resources. You can always manually remove these stages by [following the steps in this chapter]({% link _docs/deleting-resources.md %}#removing-a-stage).

Once you hit **Enable Auto-Deploy**, any new Git branches that are created will create a new stage in Seed automatically!
