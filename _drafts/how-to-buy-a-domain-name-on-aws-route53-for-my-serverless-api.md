# How to buy a domain name on AWS Route53 for my Serverless API?

Just a recap, when you deploy your Serverless application with API Gateway, the API endpoint created by API Gateway looks like:
```
https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/STAGE/
```
You can purchase a domain hosted on AWS Route53 and have your API endpoint looks like
```
https://my-serverless-app.com/
```

You can purchase a domain right from the AWS Console by heading to the Route 53 section in the list of services.
