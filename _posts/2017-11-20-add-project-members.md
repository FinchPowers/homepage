Projects can now have members that can be added through the settings. Simply, invite your team members using their email.

Once your team members create an account, they'll have access to your project in their Seed console. Currently, project members have complete access to the projects you share with them. This helps you manage the development workflow for your Serverless projects at your team.

You can [read more about adding project members in our docs](/docs/adding-app-members.html).
