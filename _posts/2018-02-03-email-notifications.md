You can now be notified via email on the progress of a build. Seed will send you a notification when a build starts and when it completes (success and failure).

![Add email notification](/assets/blog/email-notifications/add-email-notification.png)

You can configure email notifications for a specific stage. So for example, you can turn on notifications for the _production_ stage only. By targeting [specific stages](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/stages-in-serverless-framework.html), Seed allows the developers on your team to be aware of the deployment process.
