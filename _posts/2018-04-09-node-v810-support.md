AWS Lambda recently added support for Node.js v8.10. And we just rolled out support for it at Seed as well.

You can [read more about the announcement here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/aws-lambda-supports-nodejs/). And how it [impacts Serverless developers](https://serverless.com/blog/aws-lambda-node-8-support-what-changes-serverless-developers/).

Any projects using the `runtime: nodejs8.10` in their `serverless.yml` will now be automatically built using the Node.js v8.10 version of our containers!
