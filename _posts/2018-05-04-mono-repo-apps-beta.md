monorepo support is now in beta! You can now specify that a project is a part of a monorepo project while adding it to Seed.

Once the beta period is complete you'll be able to easily add multiple services to your existing projects.

You can read more about [services in Serverless Framework here](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/services/). And the [popular patterns for organizing Serverless projects](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/organizing-serverless-projects.html).
