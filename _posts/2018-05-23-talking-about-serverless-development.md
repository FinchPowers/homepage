The Seed team had a chance to give a talk and share their experiences on Serverless Development at a meetup in Toronto.

The [meetup was a part of the Slalom Tech Talks series](https://www.meetup.com/Slalom-Tech-Talks/events/250387677/) with a focus on AWS. And our talk was on how serverless is changing the way developers are creating web services. And the new challenges with working with Serverless on AWS and what this means for your development team. We also looked at some of the keys of the serverless deployment workflow. Including CI/CD, environments, secrets, testing, and project organization patterns. A lot of our talk was based on our experiences with [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com) and [Seed](https://seed.run).

Be sure to follow [@SEED_run on Twitter]({{ site.twitter }}) to catch us at our next talk.
