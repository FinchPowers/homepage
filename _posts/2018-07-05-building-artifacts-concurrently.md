Seed now generates the artifacts for your production stages concurrently while building and deploying for the target stage. So the builds in Seed just got a lot more faster!

We are preparing to roll out support for multiple production stages and the ability to generate artifacts concurrently is necessary to make sure that the build times remain fast and consistent across apps.

By handling artifacts for downstream stages across your Serverless application, Seed helps you easily manage your CI/CD deployment pipelines.
