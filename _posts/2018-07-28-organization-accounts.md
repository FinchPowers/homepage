Organization accounts in Seed are now publicly available. You can now create your organization, add team members and manage roles and permissions across all the apps in your organization.

![Add organization member form](/assets/blog/organization-accounts/add-organization-member-form.png)

Organization accounts allow you to manage and collaborate with your team. Simply create a new organization and add your team members. You won't need to invite them individually to each of your apps. And the member roles apply across all the apps in your organization. They allow you to restrict access to specific types of stages. For example; you can allow certain developers on your team to only deploy to the development stages. They won't be able to promote or deploy to the staging or production stages.

You can visit our docs to read more about:

- [Managing organization members]({% link _docs/adding-organization-members.md %})

Organization accounts and [mono-repo support]({% link _posts/2018-06-20-mono-repo-apps.md %}) together give you the tools needed to manage the workflows for the Serverless applications across your team.
