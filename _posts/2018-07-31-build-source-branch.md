You can now view the source branch used for a build. The build page shows the Git source branch in addition to the Git commit id and the committer.

![Build details git source branch](/assets/blog/build-source-branch/build-details-git-source-branch.png)

For builds that have been deployed, the build page now indicates:

- How it was deployed (auto-deployed or manually triggered)
- And the Git source branch that was used

This gives you a better view of how the builds are being created in the pipeline for your Serverless applications.
