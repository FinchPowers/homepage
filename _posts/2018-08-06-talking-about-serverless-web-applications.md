The Seed team will be talking about how Serverless is changing web applications at the Serverless Meetup in Toronto on Aug 8th.

[Frank](https://twitter.com/fanjiewang) and [Jay](https://twitter.com/jayair) will be looking at how we are moving away from the [application server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) to a more client-centric model. They'll be drawing on their experiences with [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com) and [Seed](https://seed.run).
