We had a chance to talk about how web application development is changing with Serverless at the [Serverless meetup in Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Serverless-Toronto/events/253011233/).

The talk was based on the idea that with the rise of Serverless and managed services; a lot more of the heavy-lifting is done directly on the client. In this client-centric model, security and permissions plays a key role. The [slides from the talk are now available](http://www.slideshare.net/dzivkovi/application-serverless-web-applications-serverless-toronto-meetup) and below is the recorded version.
