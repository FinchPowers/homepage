We are excited to announce that Frank and Jay from the Seed team will be speaking at the [ServerlessDays Toronto/Functions 2018 Conference](https://functions.events/2018/toronto/) on September 28th.

[ServerlessDays Toronto/Functions 2018 Conference](https://functions.events/2018/toronto/) is a community focused, single track, one day conference that moves away from the hype and focuses on the reality of serverless based solutions. Itâ€™s about fostering a community locally and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications. It is a part of the [ServerlessDays series of conferences](https://serverlessdays.io) held around the world focused on fostering a community around serverless technologies.

[Frank](https://twitter.com/{{ site.data.authors.frank.twitter }}) and [Jay](https://twitter.com/{{ site.data.authors.jay.twitter }}) will be talking about how Serverless is drastically democratizing software development. They'll be drawing on their experiences from [Seed](/) and [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com).

In addition to speaking at Functions Conf, Seed is also a partner at the conference. By partnering we are looking to tell more folks about the advantages of using a fully-managed CI/CD solution for your Serverless applications.
