Seed now shows you the name of the downstream stage that you are promoting to. This is useful when you have multiple downstream stages.

While promoting from a development stage, Seed will confirm the stage that you are promoting to. This ensures that you have a good idea of which downstream stage is going to get updated. So you don't accidentally promote to _prod_ when you really wanted to update _staging_.

By focusing on improving the developer experience, Seed makes it easy to manage your Serverless deployments.
