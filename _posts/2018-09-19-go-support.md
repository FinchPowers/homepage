Seed now supports Go projects! We provide a zero-config way to deploy your Serverless Go projects to AWS.

We support the standard Makefile way of building your Go projects. We also support the [serverless-go-build](https://github.com/sean9keenan/serverless-go-build) plugin. And we manage your dependencies using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). This ensures that you don't need to spend time configuring your CI/CD pipelines for your Serverless Go projects.

You can [read more about Go support in our docs]({% link _docs/adding-go-projects.md %}).
