We now allow you to add SSO with Okta to your organization on Seed.

This means that the users on your team can now login to Seed by using their Okta credentials. You won't need to create and store an additional set of credentials for Seed. And for users in your organization that already have login credentials for Seed, we can smoothly transition to using your Okta credentials instead.

So if you are looking to add SSO with Okta to your organization in Seed make sure to get in [touch with us](mailto:{{ site.email }}). You can also check out the support docs that Okta provides for [configuring SAML 2.0 with Seed](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Seed.html).

By integrating with all the services that you already use, Seed provides a fully-managed pipeline for your Serverless applications.
