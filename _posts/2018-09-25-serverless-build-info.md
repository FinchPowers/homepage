Seed now shows you the Serverless Framework version used to build your application. And it also shows you the console output generated by running Serverless info. This ensures that at a quick glance you can get an overview of the Serverless Framework related build info for each commit. And by integrating specifically with Serverless Framework, Seed takes care of everything necessary for creating and maintaining a CI/CD pipeline for Serverless.
