Seed just rolled out support for integrating with [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/).

By adding a couple of quick steps to your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) you can pull in modules from JFrog. You can [read about it in detail in our docs here]({% link _docs/integrating-with-jfrog.md %}). It is very similar to the way Seed handles [private npm modules]({% link _docs/private-npm-modules.md %}). By adding integrations for services you already use, Seed makes it really easy to configure your Serverless deployment pipeline.
