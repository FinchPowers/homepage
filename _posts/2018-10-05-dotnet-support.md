Seed now supports .NET Core projects! We provide a zero-config way to deploy your Serverless .NET Core 2.1 projects to AWS.

We support the standard way of building projects using a `build.sh` script. We also support the [serverless-dotnet](https://github.com/fruffin/serverless-dotnet) plugin. We've created a couple of starter projects using [C#](https://github.com/fwang/serverless-csharp-starter) and [F#](https://github.com/fwang/serverless-fsharp-starter) for you to play around with.

You can [read more about .NET Core support in our docs]({% link _docs/adding-dotnet-core-projects.md %}).
