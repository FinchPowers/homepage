A huge thanks to everybody involved in putting together [ServerlessDays Toronto/Functions 18 Conference](https://functions.events/2018/toronto/) and making it a great success. Frank and Jay from the Seed team had a chance to speak at the event. And Seed was a partner at the event as well.

They spoke about how Serverless is democratizing web application development. The video from the talk is now available and it's worth a watch!
