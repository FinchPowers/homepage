Continuing on the recent theme of making Seed simpler and more intuitive, we are introducing a newly designed view of your CI/CD pipeline.

![Redesigned serverless pipeline view](/assets/blog/a-better-pipeline-view/redesigned-serverless-pipeline-view.png)

Previously, the pipeline view in your Serverless app's homepage on Seed listed all your stages in order in a table. This caused some confusion as it wasn't clear which order the stages were promoting in.

With this new design, we clearly categorize your various environments into _Development_, _Staging_, and _Production_. Also, the new design emphasizes the order in which the promotions are carried out. Note that, adding an additional downstream staging environment is a part of one of our _Growth_ plans. You can [read more on our pricing plans here]({% link pricing.html %}).

We hope that this new design gives you a better view of the CI/CD pipeline for your [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) app.
