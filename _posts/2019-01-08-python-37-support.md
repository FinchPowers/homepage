Seed now supports the Python 3.7 runtime. You can write your functions in Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7.

AWS recently [announced support for Python 3.7 as a part of their re:Invent announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/python-3-7-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/). And now Seed supports Python 3.7 as well. We've [updated our docs]({% link _docs/adding-python-projects.md %}) and we created [a simple starter app](https://github.com/seed-run/serverless-python3.7-starter).

With complete Python support, Seed makes it easy to manage the CI/CD pipelines for your Serverless Framework Python apps.
