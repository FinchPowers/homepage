We added support for Serverless Framework apps that use Ruby as their runtime.

AWS recently [announced support for Ruby 2.5 as a part of their re:Invent announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-ruby-support-for-aws-lambda/). And now Seed supports Ruby 2.5 as well. We've [added it to our docs]({% link _docs/adding-ruby-projects.md %}) and we created [a simple starter app](https://github.com/seed-run/serverless-ruby-starter) as well.

Seed now supports Node.js, Python, .NET Core, Go, and Ruby. This makes it perfect for teams that are building Serverless Framework applications and don't want to deal with the hassle of maintaining the various build environments to deploy their apps.
