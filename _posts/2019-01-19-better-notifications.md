We've improved the build notifications on Seed to better support Serverless apps with multiple services.

The build notifications now put all the errors in your services together so you can get a better overview of the build at a glance.

We also show this in the build page as well.

By redesigning the build notifications in Seed, we make it easier to manage deployments for your [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) applications.
