You can now view status checks from Seed in GitHub. Seed will send status checks for commits to your GitHub repo.

You can view the status of a build on Seed directly from a commit (or pull request). Status checks are a great way to see how your builds are doing on Seed without leaving GitHub. They are available to all Seed users and you don't need to make any changes to enable them.

You can view the build logs on Seed by hitting the **Details** link. In the case of a PR, you can merge the pull request once the build has completed successfully. We updated our docs on [working with pull requests]({% link _docs/working-with-pull-requests.md %}) to give you a sense of the entire workflow.

Status checks in GitHub is just another way Seed makes it really easy to manage your Serverless Framework deployments.
