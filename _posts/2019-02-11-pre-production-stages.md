Seed now allows you to configure pre-production (or staging) stages right from the console.

![Edit Seed pipeline](/assets/blog/pre-production-stages/edit-seed-pipeline.png)

We just rolled out a brand new Pipeline Editor. The new editor lets you [add stages]({% link _docs/adding-a-stage.md %}), set a pre-production or staging stage, or even replace your current production stage. The new editor gives you complete flexibility over your pipeline on Seed.

You can read more about [our new pipeline editor in our docs]({% link _docs/editing-the-pipeline.md %}). Setting multiple downstream stages is just one way Seed makes it really easy to manage your CI/CD pipeline for Serverless Framework on AWS.
