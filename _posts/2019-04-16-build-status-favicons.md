We've added a cool little detail to the build pages on Seed. The build status is now shown in your browser tab as the favicon!

We know you want to keep an eye on your builds while they are running, but watching the build logs isn't really the most exciting thing in the world. So we now show the build status as the favicon. And it changes automatically as the build status changes

Getting these little details right is just one way Seed is taking the stress out of managing deployments for your Serverless Framework applications.
