Today, we are open sourcing a compilation of docs that we use internally to help folks resolve some common Serverless errors. Check out [Common Serverless Errors]({% link _docs/serverless-errors/index.md %}); a microsite dedicated to helping people debug and resolve their Serverless issues.

At Seed, we help folks deploy their Serverless apps. As a result, we've helped resolve a lot of common Serverless errors for our users. We previously had an internal collection of docs that we used for this. We are open sourcing them today &mdash; [Common Serverless Errors]({% link _docs/serverless-errors/index.md %}).

If you've worked with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) on AWS, you might have run into some errors where the error message wasn't very helpful. These errors can be tricky to debug. We are hoping that by creating a comprehensive resource, we can help ease some of the pain of Serverless development.


### Contributing

We are always adding to these docs and we are hoping that the community does as well. There are two ways to contribute:

1. Find something wrong in one of the explanations? Scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the **Edit** link. Edit the page with your GitHub account and submit a PR.

2. Want to add to the list of errors? Hit the **Contribute** button. It'll ask you to create a GitHub issue by filling out a template. We'll review it and add it to the list.

We've found this resource immensely useful at Seed and we hope the community finds it useful too!
