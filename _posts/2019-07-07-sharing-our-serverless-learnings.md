At Seed, we pretty much live and breathe Serverless. Not only is Seed targeted towards Serverless developers, it is built completely _Serverlessly_. We would like to share some of what we've learnt, with the community. And so over the next few weeks we are going to be writing about the various Serverless tips, tricks, and how-tos that we've picked up along the way.

For this, we've created a new section in our blog, titled **Serverless Tips**. We are going to be covering topics mostly centered around Serverless deployments. No surprise there, it's what we specialize in! But we'll also be writing about topics that we know our community has either found confusing or could use some better explaining.

On a side note, we also gave our blog a little facelift.
