The Seed team had a chance to give a talk on building CI/CD pipelines for Serverless applications at the Serverless Toronto Meetup.

The [meetup was a part of the Serverless Toronto Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Serverless-Toronto/events/263490172/). The content of the talk was based on [some of the posts that we have shared recently on our blog]({% link _posts/2019-08-20-building-a-cicd-pipeline-for-serverless-apps.md %}). The talk was recorded and was [recently uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUmR6jBRLiY).

So if you haven't checked out our posts on the subject or are curious about the details, you should definitely check out the video. And if you happen to be in the Toronto area, you should stop by [one of our meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Serverless-Toronto/)!
