Seed now supports deploying Serverless Framework apps that use Java 8 as their runtime.

Seed provides out-of-the-box support for Java projects built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org). You can [read about this in detail in our docs here]({% link _docs/adding-java-projects.md %}). We also have a couple of starter projects [with Maven](https://github.com/seed-run/serverless-java-maven-starter) and [with Gradle](https://github.com/seed-run/serverless-java-gradle-starter) for you to test with.

Seed now supports Node.js, Python, .NET Core, Go, Ruby, and Java! This makes it perfect for polyglot teams that are building Serverless Framework applications and don't want to deal with the hassle of maintaining the various build environments to deploy their apps.
