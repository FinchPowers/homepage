Seed now supports all the newly announced runtimes including [Node.js 12](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-lambda-supports-node-js-12/), [Python 3.8](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-lambda-now-supports-python-3-8/), and [Java 11](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-lambda-supports-java-11/).

If you've been following along with all the recent Serverless announcements that were a part of re:Invent 2019, you might have noticed the new runtimes that are now supported. The Seed team rolled out a couple of updates to make sure that you are able to use these runtimes as quickly as possible! All you need to do is specify the new runtime in your `serverless.yml` and Seed will use the appropriate build environment and deploy it for you.
