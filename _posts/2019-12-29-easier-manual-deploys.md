We rolled out a small update to make it easier and quicker to trigger a manual deployment in Seed.

Seed will now remember the branch you had previously selected to deploy a specific stage. And it'll pull this up by default. This means that you don't have to wait to load all your available branches before triggering a deployment.

We know that when you are working to push a fix to a stage, you might end up doing it a few times. And having to select the branch repeatedly can be an annoyance. This update should make it easier and quicker to trigger manual deployments!
