You can now secure your Seed accounts by enabling two-factor auth. Simply head over to your account settings on Seed and enable two-factor auth.

Previously, two-factor auth was only available upon request. But we decided to make it publicly available since most of our users are deploying their production applications with Seed. 

If you are interested in **enforcing two-factor auth** across your organization on Seed, feel free to [**get in touch with us**](mailto:{{{ site.email }}}).
