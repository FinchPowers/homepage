Seed now supports GitLab Self-Managed repos. You can enable this for your organization on Seed.

Seed can connect to your GitLab Self-Managed instance. And once enabled, you'll be able to use your repos in much the same way as your standard GitLab repos.

To add GitLab Self-Managed to your Seed organization you need to create an OAuth app. You can read more about it over on the [enabling GitLab Self-Managed chapter]({% link _docs/enabling-gitlab-self-managed.md %}) in our docs.

Note that, GitLab Self-Managed support is available as a part of our Enterprise plan. Check out our [pricing plans here]({% link pricing.html %}) and [send us an email to get started](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
