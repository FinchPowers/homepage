You can now make it mandatory for your team members on Seed to have two-factor authentication enabled.

![Enable mandatory 2FA setting](/assets/blog/mandatory-two-factor-auth/enable-mandatory-2fa-setting.png)

Recently, we added support for [two-factor authentication]({% link _posts/2020-01-07-two-factor-auth-is-now-publicly-available.md %}). Today we are allowing organizations on Seed to make this mandatory.

This can be enabled through your organization settings. And once enabled, your team members will be prompted to setup two-factor auth for their accounts.

Mandatory two-factor auth helps enforce good security practices across your organization. You can [read more on this over on our docs]({% link _docs/enable-mandatory-two-factor-auth.md %}). This setting is available as a part of [our Enterprise plans]({% link pricing.html %}). [Contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you would like to enable this for your organization.
