High performance build machines are now available for all Seed users. Previously, this option was only available in our Enterprise plans.

You might need a high performance build machine if your builds need more memory or if you want to speed up your builds.  To upgrade, head over to a service's settings in your Seed console and select the type of build machine you want to use. Once selected, Seed will use it on your next build.

In your build logs, you can see the type of build machine and the amount of build minutes used.

For more details on the performance specs of our build machines and their build minutes usage, head over to the [Build machines chapter in our docs]({% link _docs/build-machine-types.md %}).
