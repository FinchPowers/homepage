Seed now supports .NET Core 3.1 projects! We provide a zero-config way to deploy your Serverless .NET Core projects to AWS.

Now Seed supports .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1. Check out our docs on [adding .NET Core projects]({% link _docs/adding-dotnet-core-projects.md %}). And the [build image used to deploy it]({% link _docs/seed-build-images.md %}#general-purpose-v30).
