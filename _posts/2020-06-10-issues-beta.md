If you've checked out the [recent Seed console redesign]({% link _posts/2020-06-10-seed-console-gets-a-ux-update.md %}), you might have noticed a new tab in your apps. **Issues** â€” native, real-time Lambda monitoring and alerting.

Issues is currently in private beta. We've been using it internally for sometime now and it:

- Works out-of-the-box. No code changes or external SDKs needed.
- Sends Slack or email alerts with a complete log of the failed request.
- Autodetects all Lambda failures. Including out of memory and timeouts.
- Supports native error reporting. Use `console.error` to report any exceptions.

Issues is free during the beta. And thanks to our smart log subscription algorithm, it'll be a lot more cost-effective than comparable offerings!

We'll be releasing more details about Issues in the coming weeks as we prepare for a public launch. In the meantime, [check out our docs on it]({% link _docs/issues-and-alerts.md %}).
