Seed now allows you to deploy [Serverless Components](https://www.serverless.com/components/) in a zero-config way.

Serverless Components recently came out of beta â€” [serverless.com/blog/serverless-components-ga](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-components-ga/). It provides a simpler way to deploy Serverless infrastructure for specific use-cases. For example, the [Website component](https://github.com/serverless-components/website) allows you to deploy an S3 + CloudFront backed website.

You can now deploy these on Seed. Just as you would for any other Serverless Framework service!
