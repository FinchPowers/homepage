We recently rolled out a way for you to give us feedback on Issues that have been automatically detected.

![Incorrectly parsed error message reported](/assets/blog/sending-us-feedback-on-issues/incorrectly-parsed-error-message-reported.png)

Issues detects failures and errors in your Lambda functions automatically, thanks to [Native Error Reporting]({% link _docs/native-error-reporting.md %}). However, there might be times when the error messages are not being parsed correctly. In these cases, you can let us know if the error messages don't look right to you.

This feedback will help ensure that errors like these are properly handled in the future. You can also [contact us directly](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you have any questions.
