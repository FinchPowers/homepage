You can now select multiple issues to resolve or ignore in the Seed console. You won't have to click through to each issue to do so.

[Issues in Seed]({% link _posts/2020-07-01-real-time-lambda-monitoring-in-seed.md %}), allows you to monitor your Lambda functions in real-time. And it's completely free! It is also [completely native]({% link _docs/native-error-reporting.md %})! So you can simply `console.error` to report new issues.

However, it also means that sometimes you might end up reporting some issues by mistake. To clear out these issues from your feed, you can now select multiple issues. And ignore (or resolve) them in one go!

So give real-time Lambda monitoring in Seed a try, and let us know what you think.
