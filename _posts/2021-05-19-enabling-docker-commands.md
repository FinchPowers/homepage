You can now enable running Docker commands in your builds directly from the [Seed console]({{ site.console_url }}).

INSERT SCREENSHOT

By default, the Docker daemon is disabled in the build machine. And previously, you had to contact us to enable running Docker.

Now you can head over to a service's settings and enable it directly from the console.

[Read more about this]({% link _docs/docker-commands-in-your-builds.md %}) over on our docs and [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you need any help.
