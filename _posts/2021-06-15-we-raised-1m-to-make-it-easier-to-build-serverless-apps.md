Today we are announcing our $1M seed round. The new funding helps us in our mission to make it easier to build serverless apps.

Seed is the best way for teams to deploy and manage their serverless applications. Along with our [Serverless Stack Framework (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com) and the [Serverless Stack Guide](https://serverless-stack.com/#guide), we want to make sure you have everything you need.

The new funding allows us to expand our team to better serve our community.

You can [**read the full announcement over on the Serverless Stack Blog**](https://serverless-stack.com/blog/serverless-stack-raises-1m-to-make-it-easier-to-build-serverless-apps.html).
