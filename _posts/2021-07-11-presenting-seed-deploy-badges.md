Seed now has deploy badges! The little badge images that you can add to your README to show the deploy status of your app.

You can grab the markdown code from your app's settings.

And put them in your project's README.

You can also customize their styles, or change the stage that they are tied to. Head over to the docs on [Deploy Badges]({% link _docs/deploy-badges.md %}) to learn more!
