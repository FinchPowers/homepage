You can now manually deploy a Git branch, tag, or commit in Seed.

![Seed manual deploy modal](/assets/blog/deploy-branches-tags-or-commits/seed-manual-deploy-modal.png)

While triggering a manual deployment in Seed, you can enter the name of a branch or tag. Or the Git commit SHA. Previously, you could only select a branch.
