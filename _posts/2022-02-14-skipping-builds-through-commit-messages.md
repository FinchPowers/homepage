Seed now allows you to skip making a deployment for some auto-deployed Git commits.

You can do this by using the `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` string as a part of your commit message. [Read more about this]({% link _docs/skipped-builds.md %}#skipping-git-push-deployments) over on our docs for skipping builds.
