    <h3>The Community</h3>
    <p>We are also authors of <a href="https://serverless-stack.com">Serverless Stack</a>; the most popular resource for building full-stack serverless applications. We've helped hundreds of folks get started with serverless. We have also worked with dozens of teams to understand their needs and use cases.</p>
    <p>Everything we learn from the community in the form of best practises goes into making Seed better. And everything we learn while working on Seed, we give back to the community through Serverless Stack.</p>
